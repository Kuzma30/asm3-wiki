* Auto relax [certain combinations](../commit/80bceefcc69f80ae6812628a5a2368c0bbdd0a77) of constraints.

__Bug Fix__

* Fix (again) negative offset in various composite constraints
* Tolerate empty lock constraint
* Fix mover on whole object selection

__FreeCAD LinkStage3__

* Complete [[Topological Naming|Topological-Naming-Algorithm]] support in `Part` workbench and other Python features.

* 3D view highlight when mouse over tree view item. Once highlighted, the 3D view will add the object to the always-on-top display group, and make it transparent. This mouse over highlight feature can be turned on/off by tree view context menu, `Tree view options -> Pre-select`.

* Refactor `PartDesign::SubShapeBinder` to support design-in-context. The new shape binder now works in `Relative` linking mode by default, meaning that when you drag and drop a selection to the binder object, it will link to the first non-common ancestor of the target, and use sub-name to refer to the linked child object(s). If the binder belongs to some parent object (e.g. a body) and is moved, you can re-synchronize the placement by double clicking the binder object in the tree view. The binder also has a new `BindMode` property, that is default to `Synchronized`, meaning that it will auto update itself whenever the bound shape is changed. If set to `Fronzon`, then the shape will not be updated unless you double click the binder item in the tree view. When set to `Detached`, the shape is obtained at the time the link is set (e.g. through drag and drop), after which the link will be immediately reset to empty.
