__New Feature__

* Support cylindrical surface in axial alignment and colinear constraint

* New quick mover tool. Select any object inside an Assembly container, either from 3D viewer or the tree view, and click ![QuickMove](../raw/master/freecad/asm3/Gui/Resources/icons/Assembly_QuickMove.svg?sanitize=true), the selected object will follow the mouse. Like the other mover tools, quick mover also support moving object within sub-assembly container. Simply add the sub-assembly as the second selection using CTRL select. As shown in the follow screen cast, by default the mover moves object in the top level assembly container, which is why the cube and cylinder in the sub-assembly moves together. To move the cube inside the sub-assembly, add it as the second selection. You may prefer to use keyboard shortcut to activate various mover, e.g. 'A, Q' for quick mover.

* Support yaw-pitch-roll angle locking, in composite constraint, including PlaneCoincident, PlaneAlignment, AxialAlignment and MultiParallel. In addition, support X, Y and Z distance offset in PlaneCoincident constraint.

* Support adding Origin structure into assembly. To add the origin, select the the assembly, or any object inside assembly, and click ![AddOrigin](../raw/master/freecad/asm3/Gui/Resources/icons/Assembly_Add_Origin.svg?sanitize=true). To add origin to sub-assembly, you can add that sub-assembly as the second selection before clicking the button. Each assembly container can have only one origin. If there is already an existing origin, clicking the button will resize the origin to include all objects inside the container. If the origin object is hidden, clicking the button will also reveal it. You may want to use keyboard shortcut 'A, O' for quick access.

* Add a checkable button ![LockMover](../raw/master/freecad/asm3/Gui/Resources/icons/Assembly_LockMover.svg?sanitize=true) to lock mover for fixed object. Once activated, the mover buttons will not activate when you select explicitly locked objects.

* Support STEP export/import of assembly container.


__FreeCAD LinkStage3__

* Improve recomputation logic ([b2576c0a](/realthunder/FreeCAD/commit/b2576c0a9025d466881b7cf886bf46bbe00eec56))
  * If an error is reported by some object during recomputation, this object and all objects in its InListRecursive will be removed from the recomputation queue before resume recomputation.
  * If recompute() is called on some document marked as 'SkipRecompute', instead of doing nothing like previously, signal the Gui::Document to force recompute the editing object.

* Add 'Recompute object' action to tree view context menu. This will recompute the selected object and all its dependent objects. ([017da8a8](/realthunder/FreeCAD/commit/017da8a8621006037b3f4fafd30b5cc91d7e54af))

* Support context dependent color and visibility override in Link/LinkGroup (including the assembly container in asm3) ([a2f82b21](/realthunder/FreeCAD/commit/a2f82b2105d789f47c9124079ac14df7f9a66573), [2fcef036](/realthunder/FreeCAD/commit/2fcef036461cfde9efd1bcbe8fae7245f96f996c))


* Rework of STEP import/export to support geometric data sharing using App::Link, and color/visibility override ([66d95842](/realthunder/FreeCAD/commit/66d9584269384a0ff8e955ac182b7d74186a3a23), [99ae7ede](/realthunder/FreeCAD/commit/99ae7ede218a1eab6a4a09af204c3c2a5eb151d8))
